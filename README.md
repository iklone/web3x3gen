# Web 3x3 Generator

 3x3 anime/manga generator for MAL using the Jikan API. Now online and in JS.
 
 Based on my previous python-based 3x3gen.
 
 #### Input variables:
 - MAL Username: MAL profile to build grid from.
 - Grid Type: What to put in the grid (anime/manga/characters/people).
 - Grid source: Where to get data from (favourites/list). Note that type characters/people grids can only be generated from source favourites.
 - Grid Size: How wide/tall the grid will be in units. Eg: 3 will build a 3x3 grid, 10 will build a 10x10.
